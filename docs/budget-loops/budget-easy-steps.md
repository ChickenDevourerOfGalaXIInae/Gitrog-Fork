# Budget Easy Steps

If you are attempting to go off with an Anafenza on the board but don’t own the expensive mana rocks like Mana Vault, Crypt, Mox Diamond, or Chrome Mox, here is a budget version of the line, albeit slightly longer. The principle is the same: we still need to cast a lot of rituals and then Ad Nauseam everything back to hand.

## Procedure

Starting state: one black mana floating, Ad Nauseam in graveyard, Gitrog with a discard outlet in play, and all other non-creatures in hand.
1. Cast Dark Ritual
1. Cast Sol Ring and activate for two colorless mana
1. Cast Lotus Petal and activate for a green mana
1. Cast Cabal Ritual
1. Cast Gaea’s Blessing targeting Dark Ritual, Lotus Petal, and Cabal ritual
1. Discard 2 lands to draw your library
1. Cast Dark Ritual
1. Cast Lotus Petal and activate for a green mana
1. Cast Nature’s Claim targeting Sol Ring
1. Cast Cabal Ritual
1. Cast Noxious Revival, paying two life, targeting Gaea’s Blessing
1. Cast Entomb getting Gaea’s Blessing and resolve the shuffle trigger
1. Discard 11 lands to draw your entire library
1. Cast Lotus Petal and activate for a green mana
1. Cast Sol Ring and activate for two colorless mana
1. Cast Nature’s Claim targeting Sol Ring
1. Cast Dark Ritual
1. Cast Cabal Ritual
1. Discard Gaea’s Blessing
1. Cast Noxious Revival, paying two life, targeting Gaea’s Blessing
1. Cast Entomb getting Gaea’s Blessing and resolve the shuffle trigger
1. Discard 19 lands to draw your entire library
1. Cast Lotus Petal and activate for a green mana
1. Discard Gaea’s Blessing
1. Cast Noxious Revival, paying a green, targeting Gaea’s Blessing
1. Cast Entomb getting Gaea’s Blessing and resolve the shuffle trigger
1. Cast Ad Nauseam for your entire library

This process should net six (6) black mana and zero (0) life gained or lost. After generating an arbitrary amount of black mana, you can perform another loop afterwards to make green mana in order to go off with spells other than Ebony Charm (specifically Ebony Charm; Geth’s Verdict also requires you to do the loop below):
1. Cast Lotus Petal and activate for a green mana
1. Cast Sol Ring
1. Cast Nature’s Claim targeting Sol Ring
1. Discard Gaea’s Blessing
1. Cast Noxious Revival, paying two life, targeting Gaea’s Blessing
1. Cast Entomb getting Gaea’s Blessing and resolve the shuffle trigger
1. Discard 7 lands to draw your entire library
1. Cast Lotus Petal and activate for a green mana
1. Cast Sol Ring
1. Cast Nature’s Claim targeting Sol Ring
1. Discard Gaea’s Blessing
1. Cast Noxious Revival, paying two life, targeting Gaea’s Blessing
1. Cast Entomb getting Gaea’s Blessing and resolve the shuffle trigger
1. Discard 13 lands to draw your library
1. Cast Lotus Petal and activate for a green mana
1. Cast Sol Ring
1. Cast Nature’s Claim targeting Sol Ring
1. Discard Gaea’s Blessing
1. Cast Noxious Revival, paying two life, targeting Gaea’s Blessing
1. Cast Entomb finding Gaea’s Blessing and resolve the shuffle trigger
1. Discard 19 lands to draw your library
1. Cast Lotus Petal and activate for a green mana
1. Discard Gaea’s Blessing
1. Cast Noxious Revival, paying two life, targeting Gaea’s Blessing
1. Cast Entomb finding Gaea’s Blessing and resolve the shuffle trigger
1. Cast Ad Nauseam for your entire library

This process nets one green mana, so repeat it until you have generated an arbitrary amount of green. If you want to loop something like Thoughtseize, you can gain an arbitrary amount of life by casting Noxious Revival for a green in step 24 instead of paying two life. After you have unlimited life and mana, you can cast any spell between steps 24 and 25 to loop said spell.
