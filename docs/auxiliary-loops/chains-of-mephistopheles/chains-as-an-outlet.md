# Chains of Mephistopheles as a Discard Outlet

Should you find yourself with Chains of Mephistopheles as your discard outlet and you decide that now is not the time to combo rather than wait until you can respond to an opponent, or go off at the end of someone else's turn, then this loop is for you. This loop amends a situation where you go off at instant speed (all Chains loops are by their nature at instant speed because you need to have draw triggers on the stack) with no reliable way of removing Chains of Mephistopheles.

## Requirements

* Chains of Mephistopheles in play
* The Gitrog Monster in play
* Dakmor Salvage in hand
* Dark Ritual in hand
* Oblivion Crown in hand
* A draw on the stack

## Procedure

First draw your library until your library has 4 cards in it (Titan and 3 lands), then follow the steps below to get to the desired state to loop.

1. Cast Dark Ritual
1. Cast Oblivion Crown targeting a creature you control
1. Discard 2 lands to Oblivion Crown, hold priority
1. Resolve 4 draw triggers by discarding 4 lands through Chains
1. Discard a land to Oblivion Crown, hold priority
1. Discard your titan and shuffle your graveyard into your library
1. Resolve 9 draw triggers by discarding 9 lands through Chains, holding priority after your library empties
1. Discard your titan and shuffle your graveyard into your library

Now that the above is complete, your library is only ten cards, composed of nine lands and an Eldrazi Titan, with three draw triggers on the stack. You’re now ready for the loop:
1. Cast Dark Ritual
1. Cast Entomb, putting your titan into your graveyard, triggering a shuffle
1. Discard 4 irrelevant non-land cards
1. Cast Cabal Ritual with Threshold
1. Resolve the shuffle trigger
1. Resolve 17 draw triggers by discarding 17 lands in succession, responding to the last trigger
1. Discard your titan and shuffle your graveyard into your library
1. Cast Dark Ritual
1. Cast Entomb, putting your titan into your graveyard, triggering a shuffle
1. Discard 4 irrelevant non-land cards
1. Cast Cabal Ritual with Threshold
1. Cast Ad Nauseam for your entire library
1. Resolve the shuffle trigger
1. Resolve 9 draw triggers by discarding 9 lands in succession
1. Discard your titan and shuffle your graveyard into your library

You are now at square one with ten cards in your library, nine lands and your titan, three draw triggers on the stack, and you have gained three black mana since the start of this process (if you started with one black mana, you ended up with four by the final step). Loop the above an arbitrary amount of times for an arbitrarily large amount of black mana.

Now it's time to generate an arbitrary amount of green mana. This can be done by looping Crop Rotation finding any land that can produce GG. This loop also nets positive on black mana, so just use this if you need both colors.

## Requirements

* Chains of Mephistopheles in play
* The Gitrog Monster in play
* Dakmor Salvage in hand
* Crop Rotation in hand
* Dark Ritual in hand
* Twilight Mire or Gaea’s Cradle in library
* A draw on the stack

## Procedure

1. Cast Crop Rotation, holding priority on the draw trigger
1. Cast Dark Ritual
1. Cast Entomb, putting your titan into your graveyard. Hold priority on the shuffle trigger
1. Discard any 3 irrelevant non-land cards
1. Cast Cabal Ritual with threshold
1. Resolve the shuffle trigger
1. Resolve the draw trigger by discarding lands (one of which is Twilight Mire in the first iteration only) to Chains until your library has one card left and a draw trigger is on the top of the stack
1. Discard a titan to resolve the draw trigger and shuffle your graveyard into your library
1. Resolve Crop Rotation finding Twilight Mire
1. Cast Dark Ritual
1. Cast Entomb, putting your titan into your graveyard. Hold priority on the shuffle trigger
1. Discard 3 irrelevant non-land cards
1. Cast Cabal Ritual
1. Cast Ad Nauseam for your entire library
1. Resolve the shuffle trigger
1. Resolve the draw trigger by discarding lands to Chains until your library has zero cards left and a draw trigger is on the top of the stack.
1. Discard a land, hold priority on the draw trigger
1. Discard your titan and shuffle your graveyard into your library
1. Activate Twilight Mire filtering B to GG

Looping cards can be done by replacing Dark Ritual with any instant.
