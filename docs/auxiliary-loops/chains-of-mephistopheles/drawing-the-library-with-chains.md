# Drawing the Library with Chains of Mephistopheles

Chains of Mephistopheles is one of the more eccentric discard outlet with a whole lot of utility (and stax) packed into it. When it comes to drawing the deck with it, there are some caveats:
* You need to draw a card to get it started
* It doesn’t draw your entire deck (more on this later)
* You cannot use the Koziland method with it out (unless you want a severe headache)
* You will have cards in your graveyard by the end of this process

## Requirements

* Chains of Mephistopheles in play
* The Gitrog Monster in play
* Dakmor Salvage in hand
* A draw on the stack

## Procedure

* Resolve the draw trigger using Chains’ replacement effect (this is not a may), discarding Dakmor Salvage
* Generating a draw trigger on the stack above the current one you’re currently resolving
* Then replacing the second part of Chains’ replacement effect with Dakmor Salvage’s dredge 2 replacement effect (yes, this is actually happening)
* Put the top two cards of your library into your graveyard and Dakmor Salvage to your hand.
* If either (or both) of those two cards is a land you end up generating an additional draw trigger.

Repeat this process and resolve shuffles as necessary to generate enough draw triggers to draw your library using the following method:
* Resolve a draw trigger, discarding Dakmor Salvage and drawing a card normally
* Resolve a draw trigger, dredge 2, putting Dakmor Salvage back in your hand

Between weaving in and out of replacement effects you can start netting most of the cards in your library. This method works with any dredger in your deck, such as Life from the Loam and Golgari Grave Troll. Make sure to discard your titan shuffler as necessary to shuffle your graveyard back into your library to avoid running out of cards as you weave in and out of replacement effects. Once you draw most of your library you can start resolving draws with Chains’ replacement effect without dredging to filter for the cards you want that may remain in your library.

While you can kill the table from this position, it is not recommended because it is extremely convoluted and generally unnecessary. Removing Chains of Mephistopheles and establishing a normal discard outlet before moving on to the Koziland method will be the safest course.
