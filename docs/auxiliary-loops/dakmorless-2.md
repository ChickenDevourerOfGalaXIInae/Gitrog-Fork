# Dakmorless Loop Method 2

These are new Dakmorless infinite mana loops with Crop Rotation and Gaea's Cradle utilizing Survival of the Fittest to shuffle the graveyard into the library by discarding and searching an Eldrazi titan through Survival. This method of shuffling allows us to shuffle in our graveyard without adding another card to our yard/library. Crop Rotation serves as our very own Ancestral Recall because it draws us a card for the additional cost we pay, searches a land from our library and by discarding the land we draw off the gitrog trigger during the loop we generate our third draw. Before each “draw” we shuffle in with survival/titan.

## Requirements

As this is a Dakmorless line we are assuming we emptied our library with Tainted Pact, as this is the only reliable way of doing so without Dakmor. This infinite Mana Loop works if we only have 4 creatures in play (instead of 5) but requires Lotus Petal, Dark Ritual and Life from the Loam.

* Note the cards in your graveyard (`N`)
* A total of 4 creatures in play
* A discard outlet in play
* The Gitrog Monster in play
* Survival of the Fittest in play
* Crop Rotation in hand
* Lotus Petal in hand
* Dark Ritual in hand
* Life from the Loam in hand
* Gaea’s Cradle in hand
* A titan in hand
* `N` lands in hand
* GGG and B mana available with at least one land in play

## Procedure

### Setting up, getting Gaea’s Cradle into play

1. Cast Crop Rotation sacrificing a land, holding priority on the draw trigger
1. Discard titan to Survival and hold priority on the draw trigger
1. Discard N lands (including Gaea’s Cradle) and then resolve N+1 draw triggers (this is a fixed amount for any given situation)
1. Discard a land drawn in step 3 (you will always have at least one) and continue discarding lands as they are drawn until your library is empty
1. In response to Crop Rotation discard titan to Survival
1. Resolve Crop Rotation finding Gaea’s Cradle and activate for GGGG

### Gaea’s Cradle on the board and Crop Rotation in the graveyard

1. Cast Lotus Petal and sacrifice it for G
1. Cast Dark Ritual
1. Discard titan to Survival and shuffle
1. Discard four lands, one at a time to draw four cards
1. Discard a land drawn in step 10 (you will always have at least one) and continue discarding lands as they are drawn until your library is empty
1. Cast Life from the Loam for three lands in your graveyard
1. Discard titan to Survival and shuffle
1. Cast Crop Rotation sacrificing Gaea’s Cradle holding priority on the draw trigger a. If we draw Life from the Loam discard titan to survival and shuffle b. If we draw a land continue to discard lands drawn until we draw Life from the Loam and discard titan to survival and shuffle
1. Resolve Crop Rotation finding Gaea’s Cradle and activate for GGGG

This loop produces B. After creating limitless black mana follow this line:

1. Cast Lotus Petal and sacrifice it for G
1. Discard titan to Survival and shuffle
1. Discard three lands, one at a time to draw three cards
1. Discard a land drawn in step 3 (you will always have at least one) and continue discarding lands as they are drawn until your library is empty
1. Cast Life from the Loam for three lands in your graveyard
1. Discard titan to Survival and shuffle
1. Cast Crop Rotation sacrificing Gaea’s Cradle holding priority on the draw trigger a. If we draw Life from the Loam discard titan to survival and shuffle b. If we draw a land continue to discard lands drawn until we draw Life from the Loam and discard titan to survival and shuffle
1. Resolve Crop Rotation finding Gaea’s Cradle and activate for

This loop produces G. From here we can either use Life from the Loam or Ad Nauseam as stated in [method one](./dakmorless-1.md) to clear our library of excess cards to start looping our winning spell.
