# Introduction and Description

The Gitrog Monster has been the premier Golgari commander since it's release, 23 March 2016. It is primarily a linear combo deck, with a great depth and resiliency found in few other Commanders. As a powerful value engine and combo piece, Gitrog is able to play into virtually any metagame with reasonable certainty, albeit with a wide skill range.

The primary draw of Gitrog is of course the combo engine it enables. Together with a discard outlet and Dakmor Salvage, along with an Eldrazi titan enabler, we are able to weave between dredging and drawing to draw every card in the library.

This primer serves as a sort of end-of-the-road. There have been many primers for the deck in the past, but as people come and go in the cEDH community, it's difficult to maintain consistent updates to the same list, hence a new primer is created. Gitrog is unfortunate in this as being one of the oldest viable commanders means it's had more time to lose people. This primer is co-authored by multiple people, listed shortly, and the account details shared among them. Our hope is that if we ever step back from the front, we can simply pass on the account and this list will continue to be the driving force. As we intend this to be the last Gitrog primer, we have also included the full text to multiple past primers. Citations to these primers will be denoted at certain section headings with a "Citations:" with the referenced primers posted in their entirity at the end of this primer.

If you would enjoy learning more about the deck in an audio format, there are two podcast episodes about the deck as well as a video in which one of the authors of this primer reviews multiple opening hands. These link to youtube, but both podcasts can be found on Spotify as well.

# Who are we?

## bendinguy

I go almost exclusively by bendinguy, on all platforms I frequent. I'm currently studying chemistry and will be starting grad school in the Fall 2021 year. I first played MTG in 2012, a few weeks before the release of M13, and started playing Commander with the release of the second run of commander decks the following year.

My first (real) deck was the Jeleva, Nephalia's Scourge pre-con, and I played that for about a year, with it peaking somewhere in a mid-power range. I don't remember what I transitioned to between 2014 and 2015, but with the release of Commander 2015, Meren of Clan Nel Toth became my only deck. I started with a slightly tuned Meren list (but still running cards like Rune-Scarred Demon and by mid-2017 was running a fully tuned list that could keep up with the few cEDH decks that existed at my LGS.

When I had fully optimized Meren, I decided I wanted something better, and began testing out commanders that I thought might interest me. A friend recommended I looked at the tier list (this was before the decklist database even existed) as a rough list of commanders that might be more powerful. Obviously I found Gitrog near the top of that list. I already had the generically good Golgari cards, including the all-important fetchlands, so I looked into it. By the time I had decided to actually build the list, Leptys had finished and published his primer, so that was my main resource in learning the deck, and I hope to emulate the level of quality he provided.

## Kiebitzen

My name is Stark but you may know me better as Kiebitzen. I've been playing Magic since 7th edition and I've tried my hand at just about every format. I got into EDH back in college starting out with decks like Drana and then Gaddock Teeg, though I quickly realized I needed blue in order to get away with the things I wanted to do with 3 opponents. Or rather, in order to prevent anyone else from getting away with what they wanted to do. My cEDH escalation deck was, of course, Grand Arbiter Augustin IV because it turns out you have to get pretty competitive to keep winning games of archenemy with 3 people angry that I destroyed all their lands. I quickly outgrew my less competititve college friends and helped found the West Coast cEDH play group alongside asm, wedge, and several others.

I fell in love with the Gitrog deck the moment I stumbled upon that first Brewsday list in the subreddit. Inspired by the work Leptys was doing with the deck I joined the Discord server and soon after had written a primer with my own takes on the deck. I find the combos to be some of the deepest, most complex, and most interesting stack interaction puzzles in the game. Despite being a lifelong blue player, Gitrog was the first deck that truly caught my attention and held it.

Back in May 2018, I won one of the first Cockatrice Win-A-Box tournaments with Gitrog which inspired me to push forward with even more innovation and experimentation on the deck. In the beginning of 2019, I had the honor to be invited to speak about the deck on the Into the North podcast. Always feel free to reach out to talk about Gitrog with any questions or just to chat. You can always find me lurking around the Gitrog Monster discord or at GP's in the Pacific Northwest (when they open back up again). I mainly play Gitrog but occasionally dabble in Ux, Uxx, or Uxxx control lists, so don't be surprised if I ask if you are paying for Rhystic.

## Leptys

Mainly going by the titular name or with the added suffix "-207", Leptys is one of the older Gitrog Monster pilots and pioneers alongside Kiebitzen. Hailing from Finland and starting his cEDH journey during early 2016, he picked up Gitrog quite late in relation to the earliest pilots: only on January of 2017.

At this time, Gitrog had been out for over six months, so several shells for the deck were already out and about. During his adoption of Gitrog, Leptys took a lot of inspiration from the former cEDH community member Razzliox. Razzliox was one of the biggest Gitrog pioneers since the card's printing at the time, having written an extensive primer for the beast on October 2016.

Using Razzliox's Gitrog list called Getgood Monster Dredge, Leptys signed up for the 5th /r/CompetitiveEDH's Subreddit Tournament, a league-kind of event with around 50 player participants that started firing on January 2017. Due to being first of it's kind in terms of participant scale, the tournament took several months to complete. Finally, during May of 2017, the final standings came in with surprising results: Leptys had won with Gitrog in tow.

From there on, more serious discussion in terms of cEDH viability started to revolve around Gitrog. The archetype quickly got its first real online discussion space during summer 2017: the official Gitrog Monster Discord Server, a medium currently hosted by Leptys. Leptys also followed his tournament standings with a primer for the Gitrog Monster in August 2017; a primer which became to be known as "the go-to Gitrog primer" for a couple of years thereafter. Although a lot of its more card-specific sections lie outdated in relation to more contemporary primers of today, it is still used as a significant resource by beginners and seasoned veterans alike.

Leptys even collaborated on an almost-hour-long deck tech video on Youtube with the content creator group Laboratory Maniacs during late 2017, although like the primer, some of the discussion within is outdated by now.

Even though he is one of the older pilots and isn't the most active Gitrog player anymore, Leptys is still held in high regard as a veteran of the deck to this day by the older Gitrog community regulars.

# Why play Gitrog?

## Pros and Cons of playing Gitrog

Pros
* Has a very high speed, threatening turn 3 wins consistently
* Has a very good ability to play the long game with its value engines if the games go grindy
* Is very resilient to interaction, often being able to just force a win in one turn through counterspells and removal
* Can win at instant speed, making her super scary to play against
* Has very few real weaknesses, often playing around conventional stax cards with ease
* Can work effectively in all stages of the game with commander in play
* Is actually very cheap to build money-wise (the essential cards cost very little)
* Has a frog as its commander for maximum style points

Cons
* Has a low amount of stack-based interaction due to the lack of blue
* Can have problems in stax-heavy metagames where multiple pieces disrupt the gameplan too much
* Is very weak against creature theft (Gilded Drake), extract effects (Praetor's Grasp/Bitter Ordeal) and grave-exiling replacement effects (Leyline of the Void/Rest in Peace)
* Is very scary to play against, and therefore often the main target for counterspells and removal
* Is often reliant on having the commander on the field to function well
* Has arguably the hardest-to-learn and the most convoluted combo in EDH


## Likes and Dislikes

You might enjoy playing this deck if you:

* Like complex combos. This deck might have one of the most intricate and convoluted combos in the history of Magic (the Gitrog + Dakmor Salvage combo), and getting to know all of its ins and outs is a one-of-a-kind learning experience.

* Like fast combo decks. Not unlike many other competitive decks out there, our main goal is to win as quickly as possible through a combo.

* Are entering an unknown metagame. Gitrog thrives in a large variety of metagames, as she can win quickly to outrace other fast decks as well as grind value against stax or control.

* Have a budget. While this list is all pimped out and budgetless, it's possible to make a semi-viable version of this deck that can be as cheap as $200. Links to a couple of budget builds can be found in a later section of this primer.

* Like decks that require a lot of intuition. Gitrog really rewards people who take risks, as many winning lines might have only a 70%-80% chance of winning, if not less.

* Enjoy proactive decks that can still play the long game. We are aiming to win as fast as possible, but contrary to other fast combo decks, we can just as effectively sit back and relax if people are holding up their counterspells and look for an opportunity where we can take the game.

* Have high amounts of knowledge of the game's rules. Knowing something like Necropotence creating an exile trigger to a discarded Putrid Imp so you can Necromancy it onto the battlefield in response to the trigger is an example of how advanced lines you can, and often have to employ while piloting this deck.

* Like playing and utilizing your commmander often. Our gameplan often is built around resolving our commander as fast as possible, then proceeding from there.

You won't like playing this deck if you:

* Don't like decks with a steep learning curve. Again, the winning combo is very difficult to grasp off-hand, and it often requires a high amount of knowledge of the game's rules and a lot of goldfishing with the deck to understand completely.

* Don't like combo decks. We are a pure, all-in combo deck, and our ways to victory without our combo are few and far between.

* Don't like long turns. While gathering and landing the pieces that combo off is relatively simple, the combo itself takes a long time to play out. Might also apply if your playgroup frowns on having long winning turns.

* Have a meta that has too much of stax or control in it. People like gunning down the combo players' resources to the gutter in these kinds of metagames, so brace yourself if you're going to play this deck in such an environment regardless.

* Prefer decks without creatures. We play a ton of creatures, although we only occasionally use them for combat.

* Prefer utilizing tools provided by blue (or to a smaller extent, red/white) instead.

## Summary of our Commander

Firstly, lets go over the basics of what our commander actually says and does. This is the first step in accepting the one true king.

Gitrog is a 6/6 Legendary Creature - Frog Horror for 3BG. It has Deathtouch, one static ability, and two triggered abilities.

> At the beginning of your upkeep, sacrifice The Gitrog Monster unless you sacrifice a land.

The first of the two triggered abilities, this is obviously not what you want as a standalone, but obviously this isn't a top cEDH commander for no reason, so let's keep going.

> You may play an additional land on each of your turns.

The exploration effect helps to offset the pain of Gitrog's first ability. We'll often be able to play Gitrog, then a second land. Holding up a fetch as that second land is a common play. Ad Nauseam becomes a lot easier with just that one extra land.

> Whenever one or more land cards are put into your graveyard from anywhere, draw a card.

Wow. This ability is what makes the deck work. Remember the upkeep cost? Now it's a Phyrexian Arena. Being able to draw a card when a land is put into the graveyard from anywhere is what enables our primary gameplan of Dakmor + discard outlet. This ability is just amazing, and we're about to see why.

## Are the deck and combo non-deterministic?

Short answer, no.

This deck has produced a lot of discussion on the actual legality of what we aim to do, so here are some definitions and rulings that should clear up any doubts on it's legality.

[MTR 4.4 - Loops](https://blogs.magicjudges.org/rules/mtr4-4/)

[IPG 3.3 Tournament Error - Slow Play](https://blogs.magicjudges.org/rules/ipg3-3/)

These two links provide definitions of what is and is not a deterministic combo, as well as what is and is not considered slow play.

For convenience, here are some brief definitions of all the relevant terms:

* Deterministic - A set of actions that can be repeated with exact specifications for any number of iterations. Determiinistic combos are shortcuttable.
* Nondeterministic - Again, a set of actions that you can do, but this time you can't guarantee you'll get exactly the same results. You're still playing the game and advancing your board though. This is where our deck-drawing combo lies.
* Slow Play - This happens when you take a bunch of actions that lead literally nowhere. If you find yourself having gained nothing when playing a deck, you may have violated slow play rules (for more, look up the Four Horsemen deck).

To put it simply, Gitrog's "draw the deck" line is not shortcuttable, but it is inevitable. All other combos are deterministic.

## What makes Gitrog unique?

Many, many things actually: this deck is more or less one-of-a-kind in EDH. No competitive deck comes close to being like The Gitrog Monster, and that's a big part of the deck's appeal. As far as "Lands.dec" strategies go, all of them before Gitrog have been non-competitive, and effective only in more casual metagames. While someone like Azusa, Lost but Seeking does have a fast engine to ramp out a few Eldrazi, infinite mana combos or more recently dedicated Strip Mine lock builds, it is still considered too inconsistent and slow for actual competitive games, mostly due to a lack of tutors and draw power in the command zone.

What about other decks in the Golgari identity? None of them are like Gitrog, but you do have options if you want to play a B/G deck of a different kind; Varolz, the Scar-Striped is slightly powerful for competitive tables right now, being a Protean Hulk combo deck. Nath of the Gilt Leaf and Meren of Clan Nel Toth also have some potential to work in competitive tables, Nath as a hard stax deck that seeks to grind the game to a halt, while Meren is a more value-oriented stax/reanimation deck and kind of a hybrid between Varolz and Nath. Below there are example lists for all of the four if you're curious:

# Strategy

Now that we've gone through the ins and outs of how the deck wins the game, it's time to explore the ways we can reach that goal. This Gitrog deck is a fast combo list and it favors speed and resiliency as its main weapons against other decks, seamlessly switching between the "fast combo" and "midrange" archetypes and their gameplans. On the flip side, the deck's weakness is its interaction suite (or lack thereof), so it is important to pick your battles wisely when using your interaction.

## Gameplan

*From Leptys' Gitrog Dredge as a straight citation from Labmaniac_Sigi's Chain Veil Teferi primer*

Here are the main variables that one must consider each time you start a game: 
1. Opening Hand
1. Other Decks at The Table
1. Position at the Table

Next, we're going to elaborate on these factors in detail and on how they affect Gitrog's gameplan as a whole.
### Early Game & Opening Hand

Before going through our deck's specific gameplan, it's good to look at what kind of cards we're looking in our opener. Our primary hand should have a bit of everything in terms of "roles" the different cards fill in our deck. A hand with about 2-3 lands, 2-3 pieces of ramp, 1 card advantage source and 1-2 tutors/combo cards would be an ideal starter. Having interaction and/or protection in your opener is situationally relevant and often useful, but it's important to remember that we're a fast combo deck first and foremost. Winning the game quickly often acts as our primary method of "interaction", so don't be afraid rely on the speed of your hand if you're provided with the opportunity.

To start with hands you want to mulligan here are several types of hands that should be avoided if possible:

* Too many lands: As with all cEDH decks, having too many lands at expense of business cards like ramp, tutors or card advantage is not beneficial for your gameplan, as you'll often take too long to create a board presence while the opponent has locked the game down or comboed off.
* No lands: To keep playing through the early turns you need to have permanents in play that allow you to play spells, which is why having lands is almost always essential. 1-Landers should be watched out for, but are keepable if the rest of your hand can be played out and is well-balanced otherwise.
* Very slow hands: Your primary gameplan in your opener is to get a card advantage engine going, so if your hand lacks draw, tutors or enough ramp to put Gitrog in play quickly, it should be shipped.

When you've gotten to a hand that is not one of the above and has business, the first thing to do is to evaluate the "speed" of your hand, which is primarily determined by:

1. How fast you can establish a board presence
1. How fast you can see and/or gain access to the cards in your deck

Board presence can potentially mean many things, but it essentially is measured by the amount of mana you have access to in relation to your opponents. For instance, playing out something like a Mana Crypt on turn 1 allows for a relatively strong early game board presence. Other decks can often do even better than that by playing out more fast mana rocks, or alternatively mana denial in the form of cards like Trinisphere or Winter Orb. Despite this, Gitrog can regularly outdo even them due to the high density and diversity of mana acceleration in the deck. Lands, cheap mana rocks, mana-producing creatures like Llanowar Elves, black rituals... strictly speaking, our deck is littered with mana generators. These cards construct your board presence and allow you to cast more spells as well as more expensive spells faster.

After achieving a strong board presence, we next have to find ways to use that mana to drive our advantage further. That's where the other factor of "speed" comes in: the access to as many cards as possible. By default, Gitrog herself is our card advantage generator which is why hands with dedicated ramp are often good enough for a keep. Despite this, having a backup engine in your opener comes in handy in case Gitrog gets countered or removed, which happens often enough to be counted as a factor. As a rule of thumb, the slower your hand is the more you can expect interaction when Gitrog is cast, and therefore the more need there is for you to have a backup engine in hand.

To sum up the points above, here's several types of hands that you're most often looking for:

* Hard ramp: A hand that can cast Gitrog by turn 2-3 will often be a good hand, as Gitrog can propel you forward as long as you have lands to follow up with after casting her.
* Ramp + a contingency plan: Hands that can cast Gitrog by turn 4-5 but also have business going if she gets countered are also good, especially in a control-heavy matchup. At these tables Gitrog is a prime target for removal, so a backup plan in case that happens is important.
* Engines: If your opener has some sort of value engine like Sylvan Library, Necropotence or Life From the Loam, you are often also good to go. The deck is littered with ramp and fast mana, so you'll be able to get to Gitrog mana often in no time through your engines.
* Ramp + (a tutor for) Ad Nauseam: Early Naus hands are as broken in this deck as in other fast combo decks. If you can hold up Nauseam mana to cast it by the end of turn 2, chances are you're doing very well.

### Matchups

The second large factor that decides what approach we're going to make is the initial matchup. As we sit down to the table with Gitrog, take a close look at what decks your opponents are playing and consider what gameplans they might have. Classifying these by their speed and interactivity will help to define your initial role at the table.

Upon identifying your matchups and opponents' gameplans, it's time to adjust your own gameplan accordingly.

* Up against a lot of fast combo decks? You're likely to be the predator, and it's often a matter of racing to victory as fast as possible.
* Up against multiple blue control decks? Let the opposition hold up their counters and slowly accumulate value through your engines while looking for a window to combo off.
* Up against stax? Look for an opportunity to either combo through the stax pieces or to remove them through your removal suite.
* Up against a mixed table? Your plan may vary.

These gameplans may not even apply to every game, as there is a possibility of specific scenarios caused by other variables such as your opening hand, turn order and individual cards being played by your opponents. As the game advances, your role may also change at a moment's notice, so it's integral to your success to always recognize your role and when it changes, then exploit it.

### Turn Order

In a multiplayer free-for-all game such as EDH, turn order has some special qualities to it in comparison to 1v1 formats. Going first is obviously an advantage, but it's often not as useful as in 1v1 as you have potentially 3 opponents eyeing your first moves. Like above, looking at your matchups is key when elaborating on the consequences of turn order. Does a stax player or a combo player go first? Does the combo player untap before or after the control player? Do you have to interact before establishing your own board presence because of turn order? These are all things that should be considered when starting a game, and even though our deck lacks in the interaction department, turn order often can affect how greedily we want to push our advantage forward. If you're going first for example, there probably won't be any stax pieces hindering you on your turn one plays. However, people might be using all they can to stop your early game plays because of the advantage you have, so plan accordingly.

Now that we've gone through most of your early game variables, it's time to take a look at how the deck fares after our initial turns.

### Gitrog's Mid- & Late Game

By the time we've proceeded past the early turns that are more or less covered above, it's time to look at our side of the board first and foremost. Do we have Gitrog on the field? If not, try to resolve her through upcoming disruption with any protection we might have access to, that usually being a land tutor for Cavern of Souls. If we already have Gitrog on field, it's time to abuse all those sweet abilities she has with lands. Fetch lands becoming cantrips is incredibly good for longevity, and if we can get access to things like Bazaar of Baghdad, Life from the Loam, or Ramunap Excavator we can grind to value town for pretty much as long as Gitrog is up and purring. Seeing as we won't be actively losing life through these engines, they are a big factor in why Gitrog has reach even in the longer games. It's something to keep in mind when playing against heavy interaction and/or stax, where preserving a decent life total can be incredibly relevant.

If we still can't get Gitrog to stick on the field for any reason, at this point of the game it's still more advisable to rely on the card advantage engines shown above, particularly in conjunction with Bazaar of Baghdad. As Bazaar allows us to "dig" for cards, we can slowly but surely sculpt our hand to find more fast mana that can then be used to recast Gitrog. Drawing into protection, discard outlets and dredgers will also help further the gameplan, as they help with comboing off as soon as Gitrog sticks.

Gitrog's late game is not much unlike her mid-game, as our frog overlord won't really quit grinding value for us as long as we have enough lands to feed to her. Fortunately, feeding lands often is way more easier at this point due to the deck's high land count and card-drawing power. Assuming we have no ways to combo off at this time, it's advisable to consider looking into the Dakmorless wincon lines, referenced in the combos section.

## Tips and Tricks

### Dredge Chaining

**Vintage Dredge turned up to 11.**

When Gitrog is used in conjunction with Bazaar, things will get a bit unconventional. The important things to remember are that both draws if replaced with a dredge, bring separate draw triggers from Gitrog due to the following ruling:

> 120.2. Cards may only be drawn one at a time. If a player is instructed to draw multiple cards, that player performs that many individual card draws.

If for example, we were to dredge from both "draw a card" effects that Bazaar provides us with and both dredges hit a land card, we get two Gitrog triggers put on the stack after we have discarded 3 cards and resolved Bazaar's activation completely. We can even discard the cards we dredged back to dredge them again for more card draw and mill! These interactions with dredge make Bazaar an outright ridiculous value engine with Gitrog in most situations, and this along with the fact that it doesn't cost us any life, is very hard to remove and very easy to recur makes it a prime target for our land tutors from midgame onwards, assuming we can't just combo off at that time.

The process Leptys has described here is called Dredge Chaining and is used for more than just to benefit off of Bazaar. During the cleanup step sculpt (described in the combos section) we utilize this process to increase our hand size in an attempt to be less vulnerable to interaction.

### Dredge Tutoring

Historically Gitrog lists ran Sylvan Scrying as a method of finding Dakmor Salvage, or just to ramp a bit if you really needed it. Modern lists have replaced land tutors with creature tutors due to their higher flexability and utility. The most immediate question is: "how do I find Dakmor now?" The answer to this question is Dredge Tutoring. With our high density of creature tutors, we have consistent access to Golgari Grave-Troll, and can use it's Dredge ability to cycle through our deck to find Dakmor.

Requirements
* Part of this requires you to have to be able to draw a card, so it can only be done if you have some way to do that
* We will assume a starting state in which GGT is in your hand
* Gitrog and any discard outlet in play

Procedure
* Discard GGT
* Resolve the draw trigger as Dredge 6
* If you hit a land, repeat this process
* If you do not hit a land, you need to get another draw trigger to continue

Once Dakmor is milled, you can Dredge it back to your hand and proceed to the main combo.

### The Grind Game

Should you find the game is overly stalled out by your opponents, you may need to begin aggressively abusing a few key cards for the deck: Life From the Loam, Ramunap Excavator and Chains of Mephistopheles. These cards all interact extremely well with our gameplan as a whole. Loam and Ramunap generate massive amounts of card advantage while Chains unequally hits our opponent while functioning as a combo piece for us. Loam specifically is one of the best cards you can find in the deck as it generates that insane advantage while also serving as a Dredge tutor for Dakmor once we need it. Obviously we are not a grind-centered deck, but these cards allow us to keep up with some very slow gameplans.

# Beating Stax and Interaction

The Gitrog Monster combo loops are incredibly versatile and resilient. There are very few stax pieces that prevent us from winning after assembling Gitrog + Discard Outlet + Dakmor in hand. This is why people prioritize preventing us from having Gitrog and the outlet simultaneously. The following cards prevent, hinder, or simply complicate the steps needed to win after assembling the combo.

## Hard Stops

These are the cards that completely prevent us from drawing our deck, and thus winning. They are extremely high priority removal targets for us.

**Rest in Peace**

One of the deadliest stax pieces that can be run against Gitrog. This shuts off our ability to generate any triggers with Gitrog, preventing the combo and even incedental value. It also raises the risks of getting critical combo pieces exiled. With a low mana cost and an etb exile as well, this is the premier gravehate stax piece. These type of effects being as devastating to Gitrog as they are, our opponents will rarely help us remove them unless their deck also critically relies on the graveyard.

**Dauthi Voidwalker**

Same idea as RiP, but easier to remove with our current removal package. Don't count on it, but having that sacrifice ability means your opponent might actually get rid of it for you!

**Leyline of the Void**

Similar, but less potent than Rest in Peace, Leyline either comes down t0 in which case you can play safely around it until you can find removal, or (hopefully) we can combo before its higher cost can be paid. Like RiP it can be cripping when used in conjuction with Wheels or other things that might force our combo pieces into the graveyard. Fortunately Leyline is less frequently used due to the inconsistent nature.

**Wheel of Sun and Moon**

Another replacement effect that fully blocks Gitrog's ability. This one however at least doesn't endanger our combo pieces. It also sees even less play than the two above.

**Anafenza, The Foremost**

This card has been covered extensively; it is the basis for the many "Easy Steps" loops. It exiles all creatures that would enter the graveyard. Must be removed before attempting a win, unless you play Gaea's Blessing (not recommended unless you play against an Anafenza player).

**Yixlid Jailer**

Almost never seen in competititve games, we have a weird one out of Future Sight. Yixlid turns of all our graveyard reliant abilities - specifically our dredgers and our shufflers. With this in play our combo just doesn't work.

**Narset, Parter of Veils**

Now we come upon some stax that more directly blocks our ability to draw additional cards using out combo. These also not only block our win but hurt our incidental card advantage. Fortunately, Narset has at most 5 loyalty so Gitrog herself is a great way to deal with the problem at hand. Unfortunately this usually means that Narset ends up blocking at least one draw of ours before we kill it. An important Note is that while these cards prevent draws, you can still replace your draws with dredges and have it not count as a draw. You can only do this however if you have not yet drawn your single card for the turn (eg. In your upkeep or on an opponents turn).

**Spirit of the Labyrinth**

Spirit provides the same effect as Narset, but on a permanent that is hit by a lot more of our removal. With these types of effects being more broadly applicable, you can sometimes get other (esp. blue) players to remove the effects for you as they are likely strongly impacted by them. This can also mean that it is right to wait till the last moment to remove them so as to deny your opponents more cards too.

## Prevention Effects

### Rule of Law Effects

Rule of Law effects, like the eponymous card, limit the number of spells you can cast per turn. Fortunately, it doesn't stop the most important part of our combo, drawing the deck. Once you've done that, just point removal at it and be done.

Remember that now, with Boseiju, Who Endures, we have an instant speed way of destroying this without even casting a spell!

**Rule of Law**

The one they are all named after. Like all of them it is a pain in the ass to deal with when setting up your combo, but doesn't really stop your combo once you've got it.

**Archon of Emeria**

Probably the most powerful iteration of this effect they have printed yet. It also slows down all of our land mana and really hurts with fetches.

**Eidolon of Rhetoric**

Identical to Rule of Law but on a creature so it can be easier to remove, but 4 toughness can also put it out of range of most people's wraths which can be annoying.

**Ethersworn Canonist**

This ones clause allowing artifacts to be exempt is unfortunately not usually the most useful for us but occasionally allows us to slip in a bonus spell every now and then.

**Deafening Silence**

Deafening Silence can often come down very early to slow people's development of fast mana but fortunately for us it allows development of all our mana dorks and combo pieces too. Pretty bad against us all in all.

### Prevent Creature Activated Abilities

These stax pieces specifically block the use of activated abilities on creatures. This prevents the use of our three creature discard outlets (Putrid Imp, Noose Constrictor, and Wild Mongrel) and even Oblivion crown since it grants the discard ability to the enchanted creature. Our two methods to beat this type of effect (besides just removing it) are utilizing Chains of Mephistopheles as our discard outlet, or using the endstep scupt. Chains can be used to entirely combo through them, generate limitless mana, and loop for the kill. Using the endstep sculpt will give you the perfect hand to remove the stax piece and then combo.

**Cursed Totem**

This is the archetypal creature ability stax piece. Being low cost and colorless it can be jammed into any deck not planning to utilize activated abilities of creatures themselves. It has the added downside of coming down early enough to shut off our mana dorks as well, just when we need them most. It is common to see across most cEDH metas and is one of the main reasons it is crucial to learn the Chains of Mephistophles and endstep sculpt lines.

**Linvala, Keeper of Silence**

Linvala is an asymetrical Cursed Totem meaning even creature decks can run it, but fortunately the mana cost means we usually get some time to set up before seeing it. It is hit by even more of our removal than Cursed Totem but similarly, its often easier to just play around it with Chains. It is less common than Cursed Totem but still shows up in a lot of metas.

**Damping Matrix**

Damping Matrix is much less frequently seen because while it adds artifacts to the list of "permanents not allowed to use activated abilities" it also has an important caveat exempting the primary use for most artifact and creature activated abilities: Mana Abilities. So while it does still block our discard outlets, it doesnt block a ton of other things and is most often left in the maybeboard.

**Suppression Field**

Suppression Field takes things a step further by restricting activated abilities behind a cost. This breaks our ability to loop using our discard outlets, but it sure hits a lot of other things too. This stax piece likewise doesn't see much play simply because it it hard to built a deck that that isn't affected by it. Like all the others we can simply use our non-activated-ability discard outlets to get around it, but it sure hurts things like fetching and using Survival of the Fittest. Fortunately it doesn't hit our mana abilities so its easy to set up around.

### Prevent Artifact Activated Abilities

This type of stax piece has little to no effect on us. To the point where we sometimes choose to run them ourselves as a meta consideration. We run minimal artifact ramp and the only time these could impact our ability to win would be if we were missing so many mana sources that our only avenue to generate infinite mana was Lotus Petal. All in all, these are not a problem at all.

**Null Rod**

Null Rod is the essential template for this type of effect. It mirrors Cursed Totem but for artifacts and thus has almost no effect on us.

**Collector Ouphe**

This is the verision of the artifact ability prevention effect that we are most likely to run ourselves because of its easy tutorabily. You almost never will want to remove one of these as it usually affects other decks much more than us.

### Prevent Searching Libraries

Stax that limits our ability to search the library is some of the most painful stax to deal with in the setup phase of gathering our wincons, but fortunately it is again not the most effective at stopping our combo once it gets going. If you are comboing at sorcery speed, you can completely ignore these effects by simply using Lotus Petal instead of Crop Rotation to make infinite mana. You can then proceed as usual to blow up all their permanents. The only part of the combo itself that is stopped by these effects is the Crop Rotation loops to make infinite green mana. This means we can go all the way to having deck in hand with infinite black mana before needing to deal with the stax piece. If attempting an instant speed win, draw your deck, generate limitless black mana, and cast Dismember or use ESG to cast Assassin's Trophy to remove the stax piece. Then assuming you still have available green mana, continue to combo with Crop Rotation. The only time these pieces can prove problematic is when we are comboing at instant speed, and strapped for green mana, and even then only the non-creature ones require green to remove. It is important to realize though, that these cards severely hamper our ability to set up the combo and often merit removal before even getting to the combo. If you can manage to play around them though, they can often hurt others enough to be worth keeping around.

**Opposition Agent**

The new rogue in town. This is arguably the best library search stax piece ever printed. Not only do we not get to use our tutors when an opponent has this out, but they get to use our own tutors against us. This card is so good we are running it ourselves as a tutor that happens to be a persistant stax piece. It will be incredibly disruptive if well placed in our early game, but fortunately at least doesn't stop our combo at all once we have it set up. It is unlikely any cEDH black deck will be found without it.

**Ashiok, Dream Render**

A strangely uncommon stax piece that both hurts our early tutor game and has to potential to exile stuff we really don't want gone. Often easy to attack down with Gitrog or just remove after comboing, but be careful, this planeswalker has exiled many a Dakmor Salvage.

**Stranglehold**

Straight to the point and without any frills this simply shuts down all our tutoring (Including Fetch Lands!) like all the rest. Fortunately at 4 cmc it can often come down a little too late to stop our critical early tutors, and as shown above doesn't do much to stop us after we assemble. It definitely shows up in some metas but is by no means a staple, likely just due to the mana cost.

**Aven Mindcensor**

One of the more common search limiting stax pieces because of its low cmc and flash keyword (did I mention Opposition Agent has the same cmc and flash!?). Despite that, this creature actually has the least impact on our combo itself because the crop rotation loops work through it due to having a near empty library. It is still a common pest that can often blank a critical early tutor if timed correctly.

## Replacement Effects

### Draw Replacement

Draw Replacement effects like Hullbreacher(bye bye) but less showstopping

**Notion Thief**

Notion Thief provides an interesting connundrum. The simplest answer is of course to just remove it before comboing off. However because Notion Thief's replacement effect is not a "may" trigger, it is possible to deck your opponent with the Notion Thief and then continue to kill the rest of your opponents once the Notion Thief is removed. The calculation of whether this is a viable strategy is somewhat dependent on your knowledge of your opponent's deck.

Basically, you are still able to replace your draw triggers with dredging Dakmor so you are able to stack up N triggers (where N is the number of cards in Notion Thief's controller's library +1) which will cause them to deck themselves and lose when they all resolve. The issue come from the fact that on their wait to decking themself, they get to draw through every card in their library presenting the opportunity to interact with your combo, Notion Thief itself, or possibly even win. Depending on how much mana the player has, and what spells they have in their hand and deck, it may be too risky to attempt, but remember that you can invalidate the first spell they intend to cast by simply discarding Dakmor in response and putting another N triggers on the stack. They can then respond to that first trigger by casting another spell to disrupt, but for each additional draw trigger you are able to generate (lands in hand, sacrificable lands, etc) you can invalidate one additional spell of theirs.

It is important to note that they can only respond with instants because the stack is not empty, and unless they use their interaction to remove Notion Thief they will die from the triggers, therefore its unlikely they will be able to also interrupt your combo. This means even if they stop themselves from dying to Notion Thief, you can sometimes just continue comboing and kill them the same way as the other two players. Just be sure to play smart, as clever players can sometimes weasel their way out of this situation leaving you unable to win and having drawn them most/all of their library. I recommend going for this strategy as often as it presents itself if only to learn more about what plays opponents ARE able to make and how to better anticipate and counteract them.

### Enters the Battlefield Replacement

These stax pieces specifically affect the tapped status of our permanents entering the battlefield. Specifically they stop our Crop Rotation loops for instant speed green mana, and our sorcery speed Lotus Petal loops.

**Root Maze**

Root Maze is particularly tricky because it comes down early enough to be a huge hinderance throughout the game. It can be backbreaking if all your lands are fetch lands. If we ever get past the slow early game against it, we are able to do most of our combo through it. Once you have made infinite black mana with Dark Ritual you can use Abrupt Decay to remove it before continuing to combo into infinite green and the win. This can lead to green mana issues but usually is not an issue as long as you plan ahead for it and don't try to go off with only access to Elvish Spirit Guide for green.

**Thalia, Heretic Cathar**

Thalia blocks the same Crop Rotation loop that Root Maze does, but fortunately doesn't stop the sorcery speed wns with Lotus Petal. Thalia can also simply be Dismembered after generating infinite black and so doesn't strain our green mana needs at all. It does however stop Finale of Devastation loops so it should be removed before you use those, but by then you have infinite mana of both colors and can simply assassin's trophy your opponents entire boards.

**Archon of Emeria**

This guy AGAIN! Similar to Thalia, simply Dismember it after drawing your deck. Since the other clause stops you from looping Dark Ritual first, this can sometimes add a colorless or black mana requirement to your win depending what removal/life total you have available. Also has the feature mentioned before of sometimes forcing you to go off on the next players turn to allow Dismember to be your one spell for the turn.

## Cost Increasers

These stax pieces are usually suprisingly easy to go off through. They can often drastically affect how long it takes to be able to get our combo into play, but once we have the combo, we generally need 1 mana to cast our first ritual to go off. Effects like these increase that amount, but many can be played through completely, and if not we can always just draw our deck and remove them immediately after. This type of stax doesn't stop us from comboing like it might to a storm or food chain deck, but it does affect our "startup costs".

**Sphere of Resistance, Thorn of Amethyst, Vryn Wingmare, and Thalia, Guardian of Thraben**

These are all functionally the same for us except in the amount they affect the early game (the ones that tax mana dorks obviously being worse for us). Simply pay the extra 1 for the first Dark Ritual and from there out we are still mana positive all the way to "infinite".

**Rhystic Study**

Rhystic Study behaves just like the ones above in that you should treat it like a Sphere of Resistance in most cases, but it is also flexible in that sometimes you can decide its worth the risk of granting a card or two to go off without the increased cost. Once you cast that first Dark Ritual though you should immediately start paying the tax for ever subsequent spell since you will still be mana positive.

**Mystic Remora**

Mystic Remora, like Rhystic Study, is a cost increaser that you can technically ignore at the risk of your opponent drawing into something. But unlike Rhystic, our rituals will never outscale it (If you have six creatures in play, you can pull off Crop Rotation loops through it, but that is unlikely to happen). The best solution is to just remove it as soon as you can after you draw your deck.

**Damping Sphere**

Like Mystic Remora, you can draw the deck with this one, but after that it is a priority to remove it as soon as possible because it outscales our mana positive rituals.

**Trinisphere**

In order to loop through Trinisphere, we need a ritual that is mana positive even when its cost is increased to 3. Sadly, Dark Ritual just won't cut it so we have to utilize Cabal Ritual with threshold.

## Triggered Effects

### On Draw

**Smothering Tithe**

This is a fairly commonplace stax and value card that interacts with our combo in a very specific way. Triggering on drawing a card means that we already have Dakmor back in hand, so we can respond by discarding it again. This means that we need to switch up how we're drawing the deck to resolve the triggers as they come rather than stacking them as we normally would.

**Consecrated Sphinx**

Not terribly common but has the same method to avoid it as Smothering Tithe so it's included.

To draw the deck, follow the steps outlined below:

* When you hit a land off dredging Dakmor, resolve the draw trigger and hold priority on the triggered ability
* Repeat this until you have only a few cards in your library
* When your library has 4 cards left, you may draw your titan after dredging Dakmor; if you do, discard it and try again
* At three cards it's the same idea
* Reach the Koziland state and then empty your library

This method of deck drawing will completely avoid ever giving the opponent any benefit from their ability.

This process requires BG so if you are low on mana then you should cast Dark Ritual first. If you only have a single green mana available and aren't on your main phase, you'll need an extra to win on the same turn. Here is the lowest mana requirement possible to go off without letting a single trigger resolve.

1. Discard Kozilek to shuffle
1. Discard Gaea's Cradle and hold priority on the draw trigger
1. Cast Dark Ritual
1. Cast Crop Rotation, draw Kozilek and pay 2 to resolve the ensuing Tithe trigger, hold priority on Crop Rotation
1. Discard Kozilek to shuffle
1. Resolve Crop Rotation finding Cradle
1. Tap Cradle for at least GG
1. Cast Assassin's Trophy

Re-draw the deck and you can now loop Cradle to generate limitless amounts of green mana and then proceed to win the game normally.

If you are going off on your main phase or have access to more than 2 mana, then just cast Assassin's Trophy, then loop Dark Ritual to pay for the Tithe triggers.

### On Discard

**Necropotence**

When you discard Dakmor Salvage, two triggers are created; a draw trigger and a trigger to exile Dakmor. Stack them so that the draw resolves first, replace it with a dredge, and resolve the Necro trigger exiling nothing. Any other time we discard a card, we will be shuffling it into our library with a titan, who's triggers can also be stacked above Necro.

## Trigged Effects Affected by APNAP

These effects interact with the active player/non-active player portion of the rules. They can be entirely ignored but require some varied sequencing: you always have to perform your combos on your opponents turns when you want to combo through these cards.

From the MCR 603.3b:

> If multiple abilities have triggered since the last time a player received priority, each player, in APNAP order, puts triggered abilities they control on the stack in any order they choose. (See rule 101.4.) Then the game once again checks for and resolves state-based actions until none are performed, then abilities that triggered during this process go on the stack. This process repeats until no new state-based actions are performed and no abilities trigger. Then the appropriate player gets priority.

When you discard Dakmor to a discard outlet, two triggers are created, one by Gitrog and the other by a given stax piece. If you are the active player, your trigger will be put onto the stack before theirs, meaning that it will resolve second. If you wait until the turn after yours, the player to your left will be the active player and you will be the last player in APNAP order, so your triggered abilities will always resolve first. Therefore it is always best to combo at the upkeep of the turn after yours should you find one of these affects in play.

### On Use of Discard Outlet

**Waste Not**

Opus Thief used to run this card, it's slightly annoying but only makes black mana and zombies during our combo so if you are sure that you won't be affected by this, you can just ignore it completely.

**Harsh Mentor**

Are there any decks that run this card? Regardless it serves as the best example of a card we can't ignore during our combo.

**Runic Armasaur**

Sees play in mostly mono green decks and will allow those decks to draw their library. Probably not super dangerous to just ignore this card but the safe method is still good to have on hand.

Drawing the deck works out the same as playing through abilities that trigger on drawing a card, just resolve draw triggers as they are put onto the stack.

The method of removing the cards is roughly the same as to remove abilities which trigger on draw, so give that a read first. The main difference is that since these effects tend to be on creatures, you don't need the extra green mana to play around with, we run plenty of creature removal (thanks Drannith Magistrate).

### On Cards Entering Graveyard

Planar Void

You can actually combo normally through Planar Void as you can let the triggers resolve after you shuffle cards back in when looping spells like Dark Ritual. Because you will have shuffled the cards into your library, Void will exile nothing. The more interesting thing is Crop Rotation loops; they still work, but are slightly different:

1. Accumulate 4 draw triggers in the Koziland state as opposed to the usual 6
1. Draw the land + Kozilek so that you have 2 draws on the stack
1. Discard any nonland and respond to the Void trigger by discarding Kozilek and resolve the shuffle
1. Discard Gaea's Cradle, resolving the draw trigger and holding priority on the Void trigger
1. Cast Crop Rotation and resolve the draw trigger, holding priority on the Void
1. Discard Kozilek and resolve the shuffle
1. Resolve all Void triggers until Crop Rotation is on top of the stack
1. Resolve Crop Rotation and hold priority on the Void trigger for it going to the graveyard
1. Discard and Dredge Dakmor to put a draw trigger on the stack and shuffle your library, resolve the shuffle first.
1. There should now be a few Void triggers along with three draw triggers on the stack, allow all of them to resolve

## Spells and Activated Abilities

Some interaction comes in the form of spells or abilities that give a one-off continous effect to slow us down or stop us. The most prominent of these types of effects are Silence types. Getting around this is actually fairly simple - MCR 514.2 ends effects that say "until end of turn" and "this turn" on them.

This gives us an out. Silence effects end during your cleanup step, which works out for us because if you can generate a trigger of some kind when discarding excess cards in hand, you will recieve priority while also being unlocked from the Silence.

# Single Card Discussion

## Ramp

This section will have some brief descriptions of why we run almost every card in the deck. Some of these won't even get full sentences, and hopefully those are self-evident.

PLEASE remember this when reading these lists: The single card discussion section will have some cards listed not currently in the mainboard. To see why they were removed please look at the changelog. The reason for this is to show that a true "best" list is highly variable.

Being the core of every cEDH deck, ramp is also an essential part of Gitrog. We run a lot of different forms of ramp, but their requirements often are that they're
1. Cost-efficient. Going above 2CMC is often too slow for our deck, especially because we want to resolve our general as fast as possible. 1CMC and below is often most preferable to us, which is why mana elves are our most dominant form of ramp.
1. Land-oriented. Gitrog loves playing around with lands, which is why most lands that tap for multiple mana are included. In addition, cards that allow you to sacrifice lands for mana work as viable forms of mana ramp.

Mana Rocks
* Mana Crypt - Yeah.
* Sol Ring - 100%
* Mana Vault - A Dark Ritual in colorless form that allows us to play Gitrog as early as turn two!
* Grim Monolith - Plays Gitrog on turn three with just two lands.
* Chrome Mox - Turn one Sylvan Library is nice.
* Mox Diamond - Cantrips when you have Gitrog, accelerates when you don't.
* Lotus Petal - Good fast mana while also helping us get infinite mana when comboing off.
* Jeweled Lotus - Have you heard of Black Lotus? This is basically just that but like maybe a little worse.

Mana Dorks
* Birds of Paradise - Taps for all colors and costs , one of our better dorks.
* Elves of Deep Shadow - Taps for which makes it a great color fixer as well as ramp.
* Llanowar Elves, Fyndhorn Elves, Elvish Mystic - Taps for . Basic, but effective.
* Boreal Druid - Taps for Symbol:1. Almost as good as the G elves but just as effective in casting Gitrog.
* Joraga Treespeaker - The usual play pattern is to run this out turn one, like any other dork. Turn two, you only have two mana, but leveling this up is mana neutral, so you still get your t2 Sylvan or Survival. Turn three, you cast Gitrog. Deceptively powerful.
* Deathrite Shaman - The best planeswalker ever printed. Dork, gravehate, and combo outlet all in one.
* Priest of Titania - Just needs one other elf to be decent, 2 others and it's below the going rate for a dork that taps for three.

Rituals
* Dark Ritual - The most known and broken ritual in black. Allows for very fast Gitrogs and Ad Nauseams where its main applications lie. Can also get people with Oppo Agent if you're lucky.
* Cabal Ritual - Initially a bit worse Dark Ritual, but becomes stupid with Threshold active.
* Culling the Weak - Something that we get to run because of our mana dork count. Also good when we're trying to repeatedly sacrifice some creatures when comboing off.
* Rain of Filth - When decent in decks that like to recur lands, this deck makes the most of the land sacrificing clause to draw cards with Gitrog. Primarily used when going off to cash in lands for mana and cards.
* Elvish Spirit Guide - While an unconventional ritual, it's incredibly good when dodging tax effects. Also necessary to gain mana when going off at instant speed with zero open mana.

Lands
* Ancient Tomb - With a 5 cmc commander, we need the good 2-mana lands.
* City of Traitors - Like above, but instead of costing life it sacrifices itself when playing another land.
* Lake of the Dead - An MVP in the deck, as it often works as a draw engine as well as a repeatable Dark Ritual in land form.
* Gaea's Cradle - Big mana for big commander. This is a prime Crop Rotation target, and not just during combos.
* Gemstone Caverns - It's ramp only in our opener when we are not going first, but there it's super powerful and a free land-drop.
* Phyrexian Tower - A land combined with a sac outlet and a bit of ramp. Good ramp for the turns when you're going off in other situations. Also used in a few loops.
* Urza's Saga - No, we won't be making Karnstructs. We tutor Sol Ring and Jeweled Lotus primarily, with the rest being found situationally.

Miscellaneous
* Carpet of Flowers - It's Carpet of Flowers. Unless you see an unreasonably low amount of blue, this is a staple in green decks.
* Wild Growth - A mana dork in enchantment form that has haste if you haven’t tapped the land you attached it to. Weaker to taxing effects, but more resilient against removal than normal dorks.
* Squandered Resources - Synergizes very well with Gitrog and ramps us hard in the late game. Very effective when grinding with Ramunap Excavator

## Protection

The first half of our interaction suite. While we lack blue counterspells in our deck, we do have several ways we have that can protect our combo, on the stack and outside of it.
* Autumn's Veil - The green version of Silence, something I'd run more of if I could. Take note that it affects all spells you cast on the turn, even after it has resolved.
* Sylvan Safekeeper - An easy-to-tutor creature that shrouds our creatures from any incoming removal. It also allows us to cash in lands for cards on the turn we combo off.
* Veil of Summer - It's Green Cryptic Command for a single green. This card is just a strict improvement on Autumn's Veil so refer to that description times two.
* Allosaurus Shepherd - Having consistent access to counterspell protection via all our many creature tutors makes this card one of the best cards added to the deck in recent history. Seriously, this card is insane.
* Cavern of Souls - One of the deck's MVPs. A regular tutor target to ensure a resolved Gitrog or alternatively a resolved discard outlet creature. Lines that involve sacrificing Cavern, then recurring it and renaming it with a different creature type are not that uncommon, either.
* Homeward Path - The single-most important utility land in the deck. If you play into an unkown meta, you will see Gilded Drake. If you play with known players and a single one of them has Gilded Drake in a single deck, you play Homeward Path. We have so few other outs to Gitrog being stolenm, as no removal short of Assassin's Trophy can kill the Frog. It cannot be emphasized enough how important this card is.

## Removal

The second, more prominent part of our interaction suite. Primarily tools to take down the obstacles that prevent us from winning (Drannith Magistrate and Hullbreacher are really rough), they can also be used to deny mana from our opponents if they seem to be comboing off too soon for our taste.
* Assassin's Trophy - A new (this was ripped from Leptys' primer and wow do I feel old reviewing this in 2022) premier catch-all spell from Guilds of Ravnica. Arguably the primary winning strategy for us is to loop this on all our opponents.
* Abrupt Decay - Less applicable than Beast Within, but is uncounterable and cheaper. One of our best removal spells.
* Ulcerate - Hits every creature we need it to. If you consistently see a problematic creature that this does not hit, consider Dismember (discussed more in "The 110" section).
* Grist, the Hunger Tide - It's easy to forget that Grist is a creature when its in our deck. This makes all of our creature tutors into removal tutors. Grist being a creature on the stack also dodges a majority of the counterspells cedh currently uses. Grist also has mild utility usage when comboing with Ulamog. We can cast both Grist and Ulamog, then use Grist to sacrifice Ulamog to kill its self and loop all cards involved.
* Boseiju, Who Endures - The newest addition to the deck, Boseiju is an extremely powerful piece of uncounterable removal while also getting around Rule of Law.

## Card Advantage

Another part of our deck's "core". Card draw and selection engines have a big role in the deck so that you can grind and advantage even without Gitrog. They also allow you to increase your advantage further when you have Gitrog, allowing for faster and more resilient wins.
* Sylvan Library - Our most powerful card draw engine which also has a weird interaction with Dredge cards. If we're replacing all of our 3 draws with a dredge, we don't have to pay any life as we didn't "draw" any cards, something that Library specifies for us when we're looking to put cards back on the top of our library. Any two cards we draw however will have to be put on the top (or paid 4 life for) if you decide to dredge only one or two cards, so keep that in mind. In most cases we just pay the 8 life for the pure draw power.
* Necropotence - Our second life-as-a-resource card advantage engine. Take note that we can combo off through Necropotence, as the card's grave-exiling effect is a triggered ability. We respond to all exiling triggers with either a dredge or a shuffling effect, so no cards get exiled unless we're using the cleanup step as our discard outlet.
* Life From the Loam - While not something that draws us cards straight out, this becomes a serious card advantage engine when we've got Gitrog on the field. Does double duty as a Dredge card that can be later used to search for Dakmor, either with the dredge tutor trick or by just milling into it naturally.
* Bazaar of Baghdad - Usually a target for our land tutors when games get grindy like described in the earlier chapters. One extra thing of note is that on the turn you're trying to go off, tapping Bazaar on your upkeep and then sacrificing it to Gitrog is good as you get to conserve more mana from your other lands.
* Ramunap Excavator - A common creature tutor target. This is a great way to make sure you aren't left behind by all the Rhystic Study and Mystic Remora decks in the mid-game.

In addition to the above, all cards with Dredge on them also work as card advantage outlets with Gitrog on the field (can be abused with other card-draw engines like Bazaar for maximum effect) and as ways to tutor Dakmor Salvage when you have a discard outlet and Gitrog on the field already.

## Tutors

In addition to our run-of-the-mill black tutors that inhabit all black cEDH decks, we've got several more specific tutors we use to either fetch for a combo piece or a card advantage engine to either combo off or accumulate more value, respectively.
* Demonic Tutor - The best tutor in the game, hands down. An auto-include.
* Diabolic Intent - A Demonic Tutor that sacrifices a creature, something we have more than enough of to make it a consistent effect. Most often sacrifices a mana dork, or a value engine like Dark Confidant when going off.
* Vampiric Tutor - Not as good as Demonic due to the card disadvantage, but cheaper. The instant-speed application is a good bonus.
* Imperial Seal - A sorcery-speed Vampiric Tutor. While more open to opponents' interaction it's still a very good T1 play.
* Grim Tutor - Play this card off of a turn one dork and it feels very similar to Demonic Tutor. Obviously it has it's downsides but this card is still very solid for being playable turn two.
* Entomb - Almost always used to get either Life From the Loam for value, or just Dakmor Salvage if you're looking to combo off.
* Worldly Tutor - A creature version of the top-deck tutor suite. Can be used to get a discard outlet, a value engine like Ramunap Excavator, or just Golgari Grave-Troll for the dredge tutor shenanigans if you already have a discard outlet.
* Summoner's Pact - While Pact can be a risky card, it's functionality in the deck is undisputed by either searching for a green discard outlet, or Golgari Grave-Troll to mill into Dakmor. Just be sure to have enough mana sources open to pay the tax next upkeep in case you're not winning on the turn you cast this!
* Green Sun's Zenith - Used to fetch cards like Allosaurus Shepherd, Priest of Titania, Ramunap Excavator or Noose Constrictor depending on your situation.
* Finale of Devastation - A newcomer from War of the Spark that allows us to repeat all the GSZ stuff, but now with Putrid Imp and other black value creatures.
* Crop Rotation - A pretty awesome tutor in that it fetches onto the table and at instant-speed, drawing us a card as well if Gitrog is on the field. Tutor targets include Cavern of Souls, Homeward Path, and Cabal Pit along with any of the lands that tap for multiple mana. Also used in instant-speed win lines to generate green mana.
* Tainted Pact - One of the forbidden tutors and is often called an instant speed Demonic Tutor. While it isn't quite that good, it is still extremely effective and is the basis of current builds of the deck.
* Plunge into Darkness - Same idea as Tainted Pact, but not as powerful. This card is like a big Anticipate at worst; it works well enough to justify inclusion.
* Survival of the Fittest - Finds both halves of our combo indirectly via the Dredge tutoring trick by searching for Golgari Grave-Troll and then a discard outlet.
* Chord of Calling - Honestly after playing just a few games with this card it's hard for me to say why it was ever NOT in the deck. Especially now that we have Allosaurus Shepherd, this card is insane.
* Eldritch Evolution - A decent tutor that is still in the testing stage.

## Combo Enablers

Here are the cards that either set you up for a situation that leads to an almost surefire win, or used as pieces for winning the game. Something to pay attention to is each card's applications outside of the combos we use to minimize the number of dead draws in each game.
* Dakmor Salvage - Our main combo card.
* Ulamog, the Infinite Gyre - Shuffle-effect one. This should always be the default titan if you decide on using just one, as it's cast ability can be looped to destroy all permanents.
* Kozilek, Butcher of Truth - Shuffle-effect two. We run two to effectively use the "Forbidden" tutors of Tainted Pact and Plunge into Darkness. Exiling one of our titans is then safe because we have the other.
* Putrid Imp - The cheapest discard outlet creature we have available to us.
* Noose Constrictor - The better of the two green outlets, simply because it has reach. Probably the best outlet we run due to Allosaurus Shepherd
* Oblivion Crown - Instant-speed discard outlet is very powerful. Sandbagging the final combo piece to play around interaction is very easy to do in this deck - people often forget we have instant speed spells that don't cost five mana.
* Chains of Mephistopheles - One of the best cards in the deck. This card trashes our opponents gameplans while being a discard outlet to enable our combo. This card is the nuts.
* Golgari Grave-Troll - Many iterations of the deck have enjoyed a higher number of dredge cards, and GGT is the last remaining card that has application only as such. Being the only card with Dredge 6, Grave-Troll's high tutorability gives us the highest amount of probability in finding Dakmor Salvage with the dredge tutor trick, which is why he warrants an inclusion.
* Ad Nauseam - It's Ad Nauseam. We have a very consistent Naus, even with both titans swinging around in there.

## Lands

* Verdant Catacombs, Misty Rainforest, Marsh Flats, Wooded Foothills, Windswept Heath, Polluted Delta, Bloodstained Mire, Prismatic Vista - Our fetch land suite. All fetch lands have a nearly disgusting synergy with Gitrog who makes them free, uncounterable cantrips that also get you a land in the process. Getting these first is a top priority for most budget builds.
* Twilight Mire - A typical dual land for a two-color deck, but here we need to mention that it is a combo piece to filter mana made by looping Dark Ritual into green.
* Snow-Covered Forest, Snow-Covered Swamp - We run Tainted Pact but still want to be on some basics so that our fetches have several hits.
* The rest of our lands are generically powerful as dual lands and include the four basics that we run to ensure our eight fetches have ample hits even as games go long.

## Disruption and Utility

This section is here out of necessity. We want to emphasize that this is not an interactive deck, but these cards are simply too generically powerful to not run, especially with the density of creature-tutors we run. They land here by default, not because the deck is trying to be disruptive.
* Opposition Agent - One of the most generically powerful cards printed for us since the deck was first made. Despite not playing into our primary gameplan, this card is just too good to pass up.
* Dauthi Voidwalker - Similar to Opposition Agent, this card is too good to ignore even if it doesn't advance our gameplan directly.
* Collector Ouphe - Very effective right now. We run into very few problems with this card, while many non-green decks struggle to play into it.

## Notable Exclusions

This section will analyze why we don't run some cards we used to and/or cards that people often assume should be in the deck but are really not where we want to be. They will be separated clearly into two catagories of cards that barely miss the final cut (The 110) and cards that should never be touched (The Fake Cards).

### The 110

These are cards that could reasonably be added back into the primer given more playtime with the new list, and are certainly still near the top of the list for cards in consideration for the deck. Running these cards if you think they suit you is definitely the right choice.
* Wild Mongrel - As said in the Changelog, we cut this when adding two creature tutors. Just as good as it always has been, but we don't need more than 4 outlets now.
* Dismember and Fatal Push - We are really focused on removing 3 creatures, Drannith Magistrate, Dauthi Voidwalker, and Opposition Agent. Currently, we run Grist, the Hunger Tide to deal with two of those, with our instant-speed option being Ulcerate. Maintaining a single instant removal is important as an out to unexpected Gilded Drake and Ulcerate does that while still hitting the others.
* Culling Ritual - A very powerful card, but not ideal into a generic meta. Certainly worth playing if you find yourself needing it frequently.
* Dark Confidant - Just not the right kind of value we need anymore. With the banning of Hullbreacher this is more true than ever, there's no ubiquitous card-draw hate being run, and Bob just isn't fast enough.
* Lion's Eye Diamond - While discarding our hand might get us a draw and accelerate us to Frog, it's just too risky much of the time.
* Emergence Zone - Probably the most controversial card not in the main list, EZone was initially seen as a must-have in Frog. It made sense, we were still on Savage Summoning and had just gotten Finale of Devastation to do Deathrite loops (and the more refined sorcery-speed lines had yet to be written. Overall it is a good support card, but not much more than support. The situations in which using Emergence Zone outside the combo is a relevant play are minimal. Because of this we decided to cut it.
* Mausoleum Secrets, Slaughter Pact - First, Mausoleum Secrets and Slaughter Pact should always be run together. Slaughter Pact as a removal piece just isn't good enough anymore now that it can't hit Opposition Agent and Dauthi Voidwalker, two out of three creatures we need gone the most. That also means that Maus Secrets gets cut due to not having it's perfect target.
* Nature's Claim - No longer needed, Boseiju, Who Endures made sure this card barely sees the light of day again.
* Endurance - This is a bit of a stretch beyond being an "almost include" but is much better than any of the cards in the next section. Endurance is a very efficient hate card for two very common combos, but is unfortunately next to useless any other time. If you see Thassa's Oracle or Underworld Breach winning every game that you aren't, this is a last-resort.

### The Fake Cards
* Lotus Cobra, Exploration, Burgeoning - These three cards fall into the same category of cards we see asked about a lot. They reward you for keeping high land counts in your opening hand (3+ lands) but that payoff means that you're keeping a hand with 3+ lands in it. We need much more for our gameplan than just mana, so starting off by limiting ourselves to four or less spells is just not fast enough for us.
* Talisman of Resilience, Farseek - 2 cmc cards that only ramp for a single mana are just not good enough for low-color green decks since we have acesss to dorks that fill the role far better.
* Sylvan Scrying, Realms Uncharted, Expedition Map, Unmarked Grave - Each of these cards serves almost a single purpose - tutor Dakmor. While this is obviously something we need to do, they all have relatively little going on when we don't want to be tutoring Dakmor, especially the bad entomb. Our creature tutors are far better by facilitating Dredge Tutoring of Golgari Grave-Troll.
* Praetor's Grasp - This card doubles as a sorcery speed dedicated win condition, which is not needed in modern versions of the deck. It otherwise functions as a three mana tutor for Ad Nauseam or Mana Crypt and that just hasn't been good enough to make it work. -slava
* Olivia's Dragoon and Skirge Familiar - This includes all other potential discard outlets. We run the best discard outlets for their mana cost (Putrid Imp), color (green creature tutors only hit Wild Mongrel and Noose Constrictor), and other utility (Oblivion Crown and Chains of Mephistopheles). Other discard outlets tend to have a higher CMC and/or are in the wrong colors. With regard to Skirge Familiar specifically, the mana generated by the discard ability simply is not relevant.
* Darkblast - Similar to Slaughter Pact above, our removal needs to hit specific creatures, and this does not. It has some upside as a potential dredge tutor card but not enough to warrent including currently.
* Dryad Arbor - A forest that has summoning sickness. It was run in the deck to allow for loops with Rath's Edge. One of the worst cards the deck has ever run.
* Riftsweeper - Similar to Endurance above

# Resources and Credits

A compilation of several high-quality resources on the deck, including past primers, in-depth reddit posts, and more. Here we have fully embedded the primers referenced above. Some of the formatting has been altered in the transition from TappedOut to Moxfield.

The influence of the original Chain Veil Teferi primer was also a part of developing the format - Thanks again Sigi for being good at writing.

Big thanks to the entire discord server for any assistance towards creating this primer. It's been a long process to get this thing from start to finish, especially compiling the Citations and Resources section below.

This deck is the result of a lot of collaboration and legacy of these people from the discord specifically: Whimsey, Slava, Skrrrrt

## Primers

Previously, all the past Gitrog primers could be found here, fully written out, all within this primer. This was an unfortunate reault of us trying to be clear that there has been a large amount of knowledge developed long before this primer was written, but ended up intimidating many people who saw the ridiculous length of the text and decided (probably rightfully) it wasn't for them. Here is a link to a separate Moxfield deck which has a primer (but no decklist) with the three primers mentioned here:

# Changelog

**7 February 2022**

Cut: Cabal Pit

Add: Boseiju, Who Endures

This addition to the deck is obviously because of how absurdly useful Boseiju is. We cut Nature's Claim a while back and although that change still seems correct, the innate power of Boseiju is impossible to pass up. Cabal Pit takes the cut because of decreased overall use post-Hullbreacher. It's specifically weak to Dauthi Voidwalker as well, so we hope that our other removal will be enough.

**6 August 2021**

Cut: Wild Mongrel, Dark Confidant

Don't mistake this change for us thinking these two cards are bad - they are not. However, they are being taken out because 1) this update is adding 2 creature tutors, so we hope that balances out the need for 2 green discard outlets to work with Summoner's Pact and 2) we just don't need to be finding Bob very much anymore. There are better options at most stages of the game, especially with Hullbreacher gone from the format, value not based on drawing cards is far less important.

Add: Chord of Calling, Eldritch Evolution

These cards have always been in the back of our heads when considering potentially new routes to explore for the deck. With the introduction of Allosaurus Shepherd and Opposition Agent last year, they became much more viabale as we now have a viable creature that we are running anyways that fills any role we might want for the deck. Chord specifically introduces a very good play pattern of backing up your (green) discard outlet with the potential to Chord into uncounterability. I actually added these with the last update, but wasn't sure at the time of how powerful they would be. Obviously more testing is needed, but they are so far extremely powerful.

A final note about Hullbreacher and removal - we will pay close attention to how each of the more contentious pieces of removal feel (Cabal Pit and Grist, the Hunger Tide) and will make an update to the list if we think less is needed. For now, Dauthi Voidwalker is still very new to the format and we want to be able to consistently kill it at all stages of the game.

**8 June 2021**

Cut: Sylvan Tutor, Dismember, Nature's Claim, Command Beacon

Add: Grist, the Hunger Tide. Dauthi Voidwalker, Collector Ouphe, Urza's Saga

Modern Horizons 2 has been a wild ride. The printing of Voidwalker means that creature removal is more important than ever, while also being a powerful card that we need to run. In order to facilitate increased creature removal needs, we decided to add Grist as an extremely tutorable piece of removal.

Collector Ouphe is back in a bit late to counteract aggressive Storm decks that are so prevelant in the meta.

Urza's Saga ramps very well (think of it like Grim Monolith, it + 2 lands drops a turn 3 Frog) and seems very promising.

The MH2 cards are obviously pretty fresh, so testing will decide if they are in fact good enough.

**1 May 2021**

Cut: Fatal Push

Add: Nature's Claim

After testing without Claim, removing problematic artifacts and enchantments was too difficult to do with Abrupt Decay alone. Additionally, creatures are not quite as powerful as expected, but are still good enough to warrent the other additional slots of removal.

**Original primer list finalized on 7 November 2020**
