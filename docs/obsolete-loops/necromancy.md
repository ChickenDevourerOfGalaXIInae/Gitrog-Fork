# Necromancy Loops

Necromancy was formerly used as a way to generate limitless amounts of green mana by exiling Elvish Spirit Guide and reclaiming it with Riftsweeper. It was also used in early methods of winning the game with Rath's Edge to reanimate Dryad Arbor. Those two loops are outlined below.

## Requirements

* Aâ€¯discard outlet in play
* The Gitrog Monster in play
* An empty library
* Deck in hand

## Procedure

1. Exile Elvish Spirit Guide for G.
1. Discard a land, then a shuffler in response to the draw trigger, and shuffle both into your library. (Your library now should be a land + shuffler.)
1. Discard & dredge Dakmor Salvage to mill your 2-card library, put the shuffle trigger on top and resolve it. Draw triggers on stack = 2.
1. Repeat step 3 until you have a total of 6 draw triggers on the stack. Hold priority on the last shuffle trigger.
1. Discard Riftsweeper, cast Necromancy targeting Riftsweeper, using the ETB to shuffle Elvish Spirit Guide in and cast Culling the Weak, sacrificing Riftsweeper.
1. After resolving Culling the Weak and all the necessary nonland cards have entered the graveyard, resolve the shuffler trigger and your 6 draw triggers to draw your library.
1. Repeat steps 1 through 7 for limitless green mana.

From here, you can use any method you choose to win the game.
