# Instant-speed Loop

This loop can be used—for example—to cast Dark Ritual to gain unbounded B mana and then to cast Ebony Charm however many times are necessary to win.

## Requirements

* A discard outlet in play
* An empty Graveyard
* The Gitrog Monster in play
* Noxious Revival in hand
* Gaea’s Blessing in hand

## Procedure

1. Discard Gaea's Blessing and Noxious Revival it for 2 life.
1. Cast [*instant*], then discard a land.
1. Discard and dredge Grave-Shell Scarab and shuffle.
1. Discard and dredge Dakmor Salvage, stacking draw triggers and shuffling when necessary.
1. Once you have 4 draw triggers after a shuffle, resolve them and draw your library.

Repeat steps 1-5 an arbitrary number of times, shortcutting to unbounded loops.
