# Brownscale Loop

We're going to generate infinite draws, then convert that into infinite life with Golgari Brownscale. We need infinite life in order to use Noxious Revival as much as we want while looping for infinite mana and spells.

## Requirements

* Aâ€¯discard outlet in play
* The Gitrog Monster in play
* Deck in hand

## Procedure

1. Discard Gaea's Blessing and Noxious Revival it for 2 life.
1. Discard a land and a non-land, then discard and dredge Grave-Shell Scarab in response, milling Gaea's Blessing and shuffle.
1. Discard and dredge Dakmor Salvage, putting the draw trigger from milling the land on the stack, and shuffling when you hit Gaea's Blessing.
1. Step 3 is a shortcuttable loop to infinite draws.
1. Now continue with Step 3, but discard and dredge Golgari Brownscale instead of Dakmor Salvage.
1. Repeat Step 5 infinitely, but hold 4 draw triggers to draw the library.

Everytime you discard and dredge Golgari Brownscale, you gain 2 life. By replacing Dakmor Salvage, you're no longer generating draw triggers from discarding it, so it isn't self sustaining. Now you are, on average, losing a draw trigger every other shuffle. You can shortcut this to infinite life and 4 draw triggers left, which you then use to draw the library.

This procedure is technically non-shortcuttable, meaning you'd have to manually do the loop, but so long as you're not playing in a tournament, nobody should be making you do that.
