# Budget

The loops in this section are only really useful for lists that cannot afford to play either Kozilek or Ulamog, such as Pancake’s [$50 Hyper Budget Gitrog](https://www.moxfield.com/decks/VRMqj1czLkOKpOKurvGl7Q/primer). That is because these loops assume that Gaea’s Blessing is the only shuffle effect in the deck, which means you also have to play Golgari Brownscale and Grave-Shell Scarab in order to avoid failstates while Dredging.

Even if you have a budget deck like scoot’s [$500](https://www.moxfield.com/decks/xzxZkSf9P0ehqExXs6E_DQ) list or consider yourself a budget player, if your list plays more than one shuffle effect (i.e. some combination of Kozilek, Ulamog, and Blessing) then these loops are suboptimal.
