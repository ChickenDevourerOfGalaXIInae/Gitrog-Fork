# Deathrite Shaman Loop

To win with DRS we need a few things, including the necessary instants and sorceries to activate its "each opponent loses two life" ability. We run about 30 instants and sorceries, so more than enough to kill people at 40 life. This is not including the spells built up in your opponents' graveyards over the course of the game.

There are several different lines to loop this ability, and here we will list the most effective one, with the rest being found in Advanced Gitrog Parkour under the sorcery speed section.

## Requirements

* Empty stack and library
* Life From the Loam in your graveyard
* Boundless mana

## Procedure

1. Cast Deathrite Shaman
1. Cast Finale of Devastation with X=10
1. Discard a titan, shuffle
1. Discard three lands, draw three
1. Cast Loam targeting the three lands
1. Discard a random instant/sorcery card
1. Activate Deathrite Shaman
1. Cast Culling the Weak, holding priority on the spell
1. Discard a titan, shuffle
1. Discard three lands, draw three
1. Resolve Culling the Weak
1. Cast Loam targeting the three lands
1. Discard a titan, shuffle
1. Discard three lands, draw three

Repeat these steps until your opponents are dead.
