## Welcome to the Gitrog Community Documentation

This site is intended to be a comprehensive wiki of sorts and is hopefully organized in a way that it could be refrenced easily during a game or during a rules discussion. This deck at its full power can be quite a strange one, and is really the most convoluted deck that has ever been viäble. Of course there have always been [thought experiments](https://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/magic-fundamentals/magic-general/615089-most-turn-1-damage-in-a-deck-with-no-infinite) but they’re often hundreds of cards and not really possible in sanctioned Magic, but there has never been quite a rules-disaster which could be played in sanctioned Magic until The Gitrog Monster came around.

The *official* collaborative list can be found [on Moxfield](https://www.moxfield.com/decks/4fbiNVFpr0edHL5Y3IKecg). Please note that all discussions on Discord are assumed from the position of this list—though very few players actually use this precise list. We do this intentionally to get everyone on the same page.

Our Discord server can be found [here](https://discord.gg/4EgSfKX).
