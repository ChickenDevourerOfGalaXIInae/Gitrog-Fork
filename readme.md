## The Gitrog Docs

The site is statically generated using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), Markdown formatted text files, and folders. It is extremely straight-forward and simple. Contributing requires no programming knowledge nor external programs. You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/TheGitrogServer/thegitrogserver.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain, edit, and preview the content for the pages. For more information about how to format a page see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) and this handy [Markdown cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). Also you can literally just ask me on Discord and I’ll help you whenever I have time.

### Cool things

We have a wiki now! You can get rid of all of your bookmarks, Reddit threads, and pinned Discord messages.

The search feature on [gitrog.gg](https://gitrog.gg/) *fucking* owns. Try it out.

All of the sections and subsections are hyperlinkable (just hover your cursor next to it and a page-anchor should appear).

We can now use `list.gitrog.gg` and `discord.gitrog.gg` to easily link people to both the collaborative list and our Discord server respectively. No more hunting for links!

### Not-so-cool-things

One major thing that needs to be worked on is formatting consistency. For example I know that not all of the loops say the same thing in the same way, such as "Discard a titan shuffler" vs "Discard a titan, shuffle". Functionally these are saying the same thing but it would be more logical if we standardized the language across the site. This is one of the challenges of pulling information from several different people together. This work was pretty tedious so I know that I made mistakes in places.

I would also (eventually) like to have each insance of a card hyperlink to its Scryfall page. This will be a pain in the ass so I haven’t even attempted to start it yet. Maybe someone better at regex than me could write a script for it. (By the way, one thing the wiki *will not* have is the stupid floating-card-image-overlay-thing that Moxfield, TappedOut, etc have. That thing sucks on mobile, increases bandwidth massively, and destroys loadtime. Linking to Scryfall is a way more sane option.)

Another thing is most—if not all—of the title pages (for example the "Basic Loops" page) only have a bulleted list of their subsections. It would be nice to have a brief description of *why* these things are basic, and these things are auxiliary, etc rather than just listing them all with no real description. It is obivous to those familiar with the deck but perhaps not obivous at all to someone new.

And finally I need help from our budget players to decide among yourselves what the viäble/worthwile budget loops are, then either
1. Send me the loops so that I can put them on the site
2. Upload them to the site yourself
so that we can properly represent the budget side of our community, etc, etc.

I’m open to ideas about these. Please help. If you don’t want to/don’t have time to/don’t feel comfortable to edit the page, but you see an error or have a suggestion just message me on Discord and I will do it.

Thanks
